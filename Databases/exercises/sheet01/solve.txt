1)
a) Explain the concept of physical data independence and its importance in database systems.
	With physical data independece we mean the capability of changing the Physical level without 	     touching the Logical one. It is important because some time we just want to optimize the data 	  storage without change something in the Logical Level
b) List three responsibilities of a database-management system. For each responsibility, explain
the problems that would arise if the responsibility were not discharged.
	-Data Security: Ensures only authorized users can access or modify the data.
	-Concurrency Control: Manages simultaneous data access by multiple users.
	-Data Backup and Recovery: Ensures data is recoverable in case of failures (e.g., hardware 
	crash, power outage).
c) List at least two reasons why database systems support data manipulation using a declarative
query language such as SQL, instead of just providing a library of C or C++ functions to
carry out data manipulation.
	-Ease of Use: SQL allows users to specify what they want without defining how to retrieve it.	     -Optimization by the DBMS: SQL queries are processed and optimized by the DBMS to find the 
	most efficient execution plan.
d) Assume that two students are trying to register for a course in which there is only one open
seat. What component of a database system prevents both students from being given that
last seat?
	Boh
e) Describe at least three tables that might be used to store information in a social- networking
system such as Facebook.
	- Friendship relation
	- Posts relation
	- User relation

2)
a) No it'll be a Foreign Key. 
b)
	a) Primary key:
		branch: branch_name
		customer:Id
		loan:loan_number
		borrower:Id
		account:account_number
		depositor:Id
	b) Foreign key:
		loan: branch_name
		borrower:loan_number
		account: branch_name
		depositor: account_number
